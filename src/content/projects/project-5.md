CMS template is a pre-configured Next.js Bootstrap project utilized within the Erajaya Commerce Group (Eraspace). Its purpose is to facilitate a streamlined process for front-end developers at Eraspace, eliminating the need to initiate projects from the beginning. By providing a ready-to-use foundation, the CMS template allows front-end developers to start working on their projects without having to go through the initial setup steps.
